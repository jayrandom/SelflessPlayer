SelflessPlayer
==============

SelflessPlayer is a standalone command-line program for MacOSX that allows you to play
a variety of isomorphic hexagonal keyboard layouts on AXIS-49 hexagonal MIDI keyboard.

When you turn the keyboard into so-called "selfless" mode every key starts to produce its own distinct MIDI-signal
(as opposed to the default layout where the two "banks" of notes are indistinguishable by external hardware/software).
This allows us to get much more out of this toy:

1. You can stay with "Sonome" keyboard layout but transpose one bank a few octaves apart from the other one -
    which allows you to play it with two hands (sacrificing the "isomorphic" property).

2. Or you can completely remap the device to any other isomorphic hexagonal layout such as
    * Wiki-Hayden concertina
    * Janko piano
    * B-griff chromatic button accordion (Russian bayan layout)
    * C-griff chromatic button accordion (French/Italian layout)
    etc.

The MIDI instrument to be played can also be set from the command line.

Enjoy!
