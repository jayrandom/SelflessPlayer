SelflessPlayer
==============

SelflessPlayer is a standalone command-line program for MacOSX that allows you to play
a variety of isomorphic hexagonal keyboard layouts on AXIS-49 hexagonal MIDI keyboard.

When you turn the keyboard into so-called "selfless" mode (press "Octave transposition down" key while plugging the device in)
every key starts to produce its own distinct MIDI-signal, as opposed to the "native" mode
(press "Octave transposition up" key while plugging the device in)
where the two "banks" of notes are indistinguishable by external hardware/software.

Selfless mode allows us to get much more out of this toy:

1. You can stay with "Sonome" keyboard layout but transpose one bank a few octaves apart from the other one (-o),
    which extends the overall range and it makes more sense to play with two hands (sacrificing the "isomorphic" property).

2. Or you can completely remap the device to any other isomorphic hexagonal layout such as
    * Wiki-Hayden concertina (-w)
    * Janko piano (-j)
    * B-griff (Russian bayan) chromatic button accordion (-b)
    * C-griff (French/Italian) chromatic button accordion (-c)
    * An arbitrary isomorphic hexabonal layout defined by 3 parameters (-a d:e:f)
See bottom of this document for complete layout maps and their "formula" relative to any given note X.

The MIDI instrument:channel:msb_bank:lsb_bank to be played can also be set from the command line (-i).
If you want two banks to play different instruments, use the same configuration format for the right bank (-y).

It should now compile both on Snow Leopard (Mac OSX 10.6) and Leopard (Mac OSX 10.5).
If it complains please make sure you have commented/uncommented the right line in Makefile.

Enjoy!
