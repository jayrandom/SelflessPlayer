SelflessPlayer
==============

SelflessPlayer is a standalone command-line program for MacOSX that allows you to play
a variety of isomorphic hexagonal keyboard layouts on AXIS-49 hexagonal MIDI keyboard.

When you turn the keyboard into so-called "selfless" mode every key starts to produce its own distinct MIDI-signal
(as opposed to the default layout where the two "banks" of notes are indistinguishable by external hardware/software).
This allows us to get much more out of this toy:

1. You can stay with "Sonome" keyboard layout but transpose one bank a few octaves apart from the other one -
    which extends the overall range and it makes more sense to play with two hands (sacrificing the "isomorphic" property).

2. Or you can completely remap the device to any other isomorphic hexagonal layout such as
    * Wiki-Hayden concertina (-w)
    * Janko piano (-j)
    * B-griff (Russian bayan) chromatic button accordion (-b)
    * C-griff (French/Italian) chromatic button accordion (-c)
    etc.

The MIDI instrument:channel:bank to be played can also be set from the command line (-i).

It should now compile both on Snow Leopard (Mac OSX 10.6) and Leopard (Mac OSX 10.5).
If it complains please make sure you have commented/uncommented the right line in Makefile.

Enjoy!
